Magic in this setting is an ever present force that permeates all the air and all that breathes it. Some creatures have evolved to harness this force and expel it.


Should magic be visible or non-visible:
- Visible means there would be easy indicators of who is magic and leads to a plot based more about being ostracized from society based on uncontrollable factors
- Invisible means there would be no clear indicators on who is magic or not which could lead to a plot more based around mistrust, paranoia and social witch hunts
