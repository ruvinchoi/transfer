The Ephemeral is a fickle form, shifting and changing as the ocean changes its current. Intrinsically linked to the Physical form they share roles in each other's development. [[Grafting]] as a practice inherently works on the process on altering the Ephemeral to effect the Physical. Splitting the link between the pair removes a natural shielding from outside influence. The caster must take special care to keep their Ephemeral in check and shape it in only desired paths, losing control means both your forms are left to the wills of the world, and many will not find them merciful.
