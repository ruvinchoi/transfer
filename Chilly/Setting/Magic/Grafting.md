**Summary**
Grafting is the process of attaching a part of another living being (an other) to yourself.

Living beings are born with two bodies: Corporeal and [[Ephemeral]].

Grafting is a practice that requires a great mental fortitude to achieve as to properly graft another being on to oneself, they must have a thorough grasp on the form of their [[Ephemeral]] as an incomplete understanding could lead to the process not preceding or the attempted caster being [[Unmoored]] To graft an other to oneself the caster must separate from themselves a part of their physical body (arm, head, appendix, etc.) and bring in physical contact the other they wish to be grafted; if the process is successful the sinew and muscle will lash together, attaching the two. For the process to function, both the wounds from caster and other must be relatively fresh as one cannot graft onto a closed wound and rotting limb will be a detriment no matter from who it came. 

Grafting also has the consequence of sharing a small amount of the [[Ephemeral]] of the other. This can give beneficial features but has the consequence of making it harder to have a grasp on one's [[Ephemeral]] as other influences are introduces and can cloud a mind.

When the process goes awry and the caster loses hold of their [[Ephemeral]] they may, if they're lucky, become a mindless slurry of writhing nerves and sinew, to be washed away by the next rainfall, or perhaps live out the rest of their days as a weasel or insect of some sort, being troubled rarely, if at all, with glimpses of what they once were; but for the majority, they serve a fate that makes living life as a dung beetle heavenly in comparison, they become [[Unmoored]]. A caster must have[[What Does it Mean to Understand One's Ephemeral self?| a firm understanding of their Ephemeral]].

The more and more a caster adds to themselves leads to more and more contaminants to their [[Ephemeral]] is added meaning it is harder to understand and properly manipulate their [[Ephemeral]]
