Tess tip-toes around the crumbled ruins of a once resplendent Walmart. Cheap blue and yellow paint peels from crumbled pieces of concrete that litter the ground. Stray rusted rebar extrudes from broken pillars. A poster reading 'Great Discount!' lays forgotten. Pausing every other step to listen, 'rumbles still far'. She hefts rubble and whatever shelves that wasn't shrapnel looking for a box, bag, anything that hasn't already been picked apart by scavengers before her. Sifting through dust she curses as a stray shard of glass slashes a red jagged zig-zag across her palm. As she smears her palm on her pant leg a long sigh escapes her lungs. She looks to scavenge the Trader Joe's next, a silver glint shone from under the splintered remains of a pallet in the setting sun. Scrambling over chunks of cement and drywall, Tess digs the metallic object from under the rubble. "Yes, Finally!" she holds the object aloft as if it were the Nobel prize. A dented can of Campbell's Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup! Sure, it had a leak but from the heft of it, it had to be at least half-full, that was enough.


Creeping the streets at night is unsettling during the best of times but the street lights laying like felled trees and the blown apart buildings did not help the matter. In an almost cyclical pattern, Tess' green eyes scans her surroundings. Swivelling her head like a meerkat, searching shadows for a pin pricks of light, then sweeping the floor for any odd bumps or suspiciously arranged piles of rubble; this on and on until she passed the splintered threshold of a now shattered McDonalds, the golden arches leaning against the main building, more a dust-bunny brown than their once magnificent mustard yellow. Her footsteps crackled as she step into the ordering area, floor littered with glass and a soggy cardboard cutout of Ronald looming from the shadows. Shuffling came from behind the front counter. Straightening herself, Tess stomps the first few beats from Jingle Bells pausing for a response. Her bloody hand tenses against a dull, rusted pocket knife. She exhales her jitters and loosens her posture as three knocks reverberated from behind the counter. Swinging her legs across she hops over the counter, landing on a handful of loose change that littered the floor and next to a surly-looking man clicking back on a flashlight and applying new bandaging to the leg of a boy who's bagged, emerald eyes shines with an excitement that made Tess' dust covered face break out into a uncontrollable grin. 
"Hey ya trash goblin, how're ya holding up?" 
"Hungry but Jean says my leg's not leaking as much pus anymore; wanna see?" 
Jean pushes the boy's leg back onto his lap,
"Sit still."
The boy shrinks at his harsh tone.
"Just..." - Jean pinches the bridge of his nose - ", stay put for a few more minutes, then you can show off your leg as much as you want, alright?"
"Don't worry Sammy, Jean acts all tough but he's more afraid of you than you're of 'im. He's like a spider." 
Using her fingers to mimic mandibles she hisses at Sammy, setting him off into a giggling fit, much to Jean's dismay.
Tess raises the glorious, dented can.
"Anyone up for soup?"


Tess flinches at the sting of cool antiseptic seeping into her palm.
"I'd expect you to wriggle less than your brother."
Unfolding a crusty, tattered map of the city, "At least I ain't oozing pus everywhere- OW!"
Jean dabs sharply at her wound "Sure."
To distract herself from the sting she traces a path along the page that has began to fade away from repetition. Notes and detours made were scrawled across face of the map with blue ink, purple crayon and a few drops of blood. She studies every wrinkle, every dirt stain under the flashlight's beam. She rereads until the memory is as vivid as that of the fate of Sammy's third hamster.
"If we get up early and cut 'cross the highway we should be able to make it to the bank before dusk."
"That's *if* nothing goes wrong."
"Nothing'll go wrong."
"Unlikely, with Sam's leg," - he gestures at the boy, curled up under Tess' varsity sweater - ", and the time we'll have to spend avoiding mines we-"
"*Jean*. Look at me," her tone startles him off his soap box, 
"*Nothing* will go wrong, understand?"
He looks to the floor,
"Fine, but do you think your professor will let us walk out of there carrying away his life's work."
"He can be a tool sometimes but he'd be sympathetic."
"And if he's not?"
"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it."
"Sure, anyways," - he stretches, finishing wrapping a bandage around her palm - "I think I'll turn in for tonight. Got to have a good night's rest for tomorrow."
"Sure thing, I'll jus' look over the map for a wee bit longer."
Rummaging in his bag, Jean tosses a fist sized object wrapped in yellowed, patterned paper to Tess.
"What's this?" she turns it over in her hands.
"Its a burger, I found it the back while scavenging. Don't think I didn't see you giving your share of soup to Sam."
"Is this thing safe to eat?"
"With the preservatives they put in that thing, it will probably outlive us."
Tess brushes some dust off the top bun before taking a bite, 'stale'. She looks back at Jean settling his head on a very soft-looking piece of concrete.
"'night Spider."
He gives a simple grunt in response.
